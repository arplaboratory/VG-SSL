# VG_SSL

This repo is to investigate visual geo-localization with self-supervised representation learning methods.

The baseline VG framework refers to *deep-visual-geo-localization-benchmark*(https://github.com/gmberton/deep-visual-geo-localization-benchmark).

Thank you for these brilliant works!
